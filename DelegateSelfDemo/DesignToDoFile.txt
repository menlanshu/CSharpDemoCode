## Optimze code for if/else
How to optimize code for if/else?
- use Func? move if/else out from class?
- if this better? This function should be in shopping class or not?
- We have a product/shoppting cart library. Then we can pass in differnt delegate to make class do different actions
- for winform show messagebox, for console show console, we can have a try.

Add an action to tell user we're in discounting
